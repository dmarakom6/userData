# userData
A simple python script for signing up or loging in, but every single information about the user is stored in txt files. This might come in handy for apps or web applications.
If you want to use this program, you must have a copy of the license above, and mention the actual maker.
UserData.txt: This file contains each user's info, once he registers
Loggedin.txt: This file contains which user logged in, and when. (year/month/day/min/sec/ms)
LogginAttempts.txt: Same as above, though it captures only failed login attempts from the user(s)
